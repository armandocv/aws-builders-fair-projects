| Title | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [RhythmCloud 2.0:  Now with Robotics](RhythmCloud) | RhythmCloud 2019 taught people to play acoustic drums by following patterns of LEDs lit in the drums.  RhythmCloud 2.0 adds robotics to the teaching repertoire.  Now, students can have a robotic teacher play a sequence that they repeat back and have evaluated for accuracy.  Robotics will be done through IoT Core and Greengrass as will the control of the LEDs and drum sensors.  A UI is provided to the user via a serverless webapp through S3, API Gateway and Lambda. |
| [Rock A Bye Baby](rock-a-bye-baby) | "Rock-A-Bye Baby" detects when baby wakes up from sleep and takes different actions, based on configurable settings. The actions include playing lullaby/sleep sounds and notifying parents. Parents will also be able to monitor through live video feed and track baby's historic sleep patterns using a mobile app. |
| [Smart Recycle](aws-smart-recycle) | Did you ever have trouble identifying which items goes into recycle bin and which goes into the regular garbage bin? Look no further than "The Recycle Kit". It can differentiate between recyclable and non recyclable items. It will provide a visual indicator RED for Trash and GREEN for recycle. When it finds an item with low confidence the color will be yellow. This kit will contain all the elements for you to build it home. You will have an option to compete in a virtual Recycling competition. |
